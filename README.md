**Transformice's API written in Lua (5.1▲) using the Luvit runtime environment**

## About

[Transformice](https://www.transformice.com/) is an online independent multiplayer free-to-play platform video game created by the French company [Atelier801](http://societe.atelier801.com/).

[Luvit](https://luvit.io/) is an open-source, asynchronous I/O Lua runtime environment that makes requests and connections possible for the Lua programming language.

**Transfromage API** is a [documented API](docs) that allows developers to make bots for the aforementioned game.

This API had many indirect contributors, including [@Tocutoeltuco](https://github.com/Tocutoeltuco), [@Useems](https://github.com/Useems), [@Turkitutu](https://github.com/Turkitutu), [@Athesdrake](https://github.com/Athesdrake) and the [python version of Transfromage API](https://github.com/Tocutoeltuco/transfromage).

## Keys Endpoint

This API depends on an [endpoint](https://api.tocu.tk/get_transformice_keys.php) that gives you access to the Transformice encryption keys.

To use it you will need a token which you can get by [applying on this form](https://forms.gle/N6Et1hLGQ9hmg95F6). See below to know the names of Transfromage managers who handle the token system.

## Installation

- To install Luvit, visit https://luvit.io and follow the instructions provided for your platform.
	- If you face problems installing it on Windows, please use [Get-Lit](https://github.com/SinisterRectus/get-lit)
- To install **Transfromage**, run `lit install Lautenschlager-id/transfromage`
- Run your bot script using luvit, for example: `luvit bot.lua`

###### If you are new and can't follow these steps, please consider using the _MyFirstBot.zip_ that has been premade with the executables and the API.<br>_(4MB)_ [Windows](https://github.com/Lautenschlager-id/Transfromage/raw/master/MyFirstBot/Windows.zip) | [Linux](https://github.com/Lautenschlager-id/Transfromage/raw/master/MyFirstBot/Linux.zip)

### API Update

To update the API automatically all you need to do is to create a file named `autoupdate` in the bot's path.<br>
You can create it running `cd. > autoupdate` (for Windows) or `touch autoupdate` (for Linux);

The update will overwrite all the old files and dependencies.

For semi-automatic updates (which asks for your permission before updating), create the file `semiautoupdate` instead.

The best way to contribute to this API is by ~~donating~~ creating pull requests with bug fixes and new events / methods (like joining the map editor, getting a map XML, loading Lua...)
